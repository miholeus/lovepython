    <h3>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</h3>

    <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Simple is better than complex.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Complex is better than complicated.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Flat is better than nested.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Sparse is better than dense.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Readability counts.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Although practicality beats purity.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Errors should never pass silently.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Now is better than never.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Although never is often better than *right* now.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</li>
